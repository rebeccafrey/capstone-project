# Seelenleben

I developed Seelenleben as my final project for [neuefische](https://www.neuefische.de) web developer bootcamp in spring 2020.

We live in a quite extraverted world, however, it is estimated that up to [50% of Germany's population](https://www.apotheken-umschau.de/Psyche/Introvertiertheit-Eine-unterschaetzte-Eigenschaft-224883.html) is more on the introverted side.
Seelenleben was realized in order to cultivate increased exchange between those human beings that are more introverted and those more extraverted, made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)database.
The user can easily find out if s/he is more on the intro- or extroverted side by going through a list of statements. In the interest of boosting understanding and eventually promote further appreciation, the user additionally has the possibility to note down topics and situations s/he would like to discuss, finding out more about how one reacts in those specified circumstances.
